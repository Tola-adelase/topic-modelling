# topic modelling
In this project, three topic modelling techniques; Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Latent Semantic Analysis, Hierarchical Dirichlet were studied and compared to see how they performed on a dataset that contains medium articles titles, the comparison were made to test factors like response time, throughput, divergence, and overall quality. The data was  preprocessed before the three algorithms were applied. Several visualizations were done to illustrate how each technique performed.
